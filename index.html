            <h2>About FROM</h2>
            <p>The Working Formal Methods Symposium (FROM) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners who work on formal methods by contributing new theoretical results, methods, techniques, and frameworks, and/or by creating or using software tools that apply theoretical contributions. Formal methods emphasise the use of mathematical techniques and rigour in developing software and hardware. They can be used to specify, verify, and analyse systems at any stage in their life cycle: requirements engineering, modeling, design, architecture, implementation, testing, maintenance and evolution. This assumes on one hand the development of adequate mathematical methods and frameworks and on the other hand the development of tools that help the user effectively apply these methods and frameworks.</p>
            
            <p><strong>FROM 2025</strong> is organized by the <a href="https://www.info.uaic.ro/">Faculty of Computer Science</a> in Iaşi, and it is part of a
                series of symposiums organised on a rotating basis by the <a href="https://fmi.unibuc.ro/">Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Bucharest</a>, the <a href="https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/">Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Babeș-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca</a>, the <a href="https://www.info.uaic.ro/en/home-page-2/">Faculty of Computer Science of the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iași</a>, and the <a href="https://www.info.uvt.ro/en/">Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of the West University of Timișoara</a>
